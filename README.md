## What's Kords ?

Kords is an app for ukulele players, which aims to help finding how to play chords and also find their names, using how they're played.

## How does it work ?

- __Find how to play a chord :__ write the chord's name into the search bar using english notation (i.e. : a `G minor` chord should be searched as `Gm`).
- __Find the name of a chord :__ use the buttons to build your chord, and let their app show its name.

## Where is it available ?

Currently available only on Android, in French and English.

## What can I do if I spot a bug, or have an idea ?
